# Assault Cube Internal

Assault cube internal, cheat for the game assault cube with great functionality and imgui implementation. I think this will be a good example for newcomers who are just starting to write something like this. At some points the code could be implemented not as a fecal matter, but I am too lazy to edit the structure of the project, so I leave it as it is.
